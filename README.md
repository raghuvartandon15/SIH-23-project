## üìùDescription

### Problem Description:

There is a lack of a unified platform for inter-state institution-level verification, causing eligible students studying in other states to be denied scholarship benefits. Issues like:
- Denied scholarships for out-of-state students.
- Lack of inter-state coordination.
- Administrative verification burden.
- Data silos between states.

The institute-level verification portal aims to overcome challenges by creating a central hub for inter-state institution-level student verification to ensure eligible students receive scholarship benefits seamlessly.

### Proposed System

The Institute-Level Verification Portal aims to leverage advanced technology to enable seamless verification of students studying in other states, ensuring equitable access to scholarship benefits and fostering educational empowerment across regions.
- Enhanced security with Aadhaar-based verification.
- Achieved a seamless user experience by integrating the solution across both mobile and web platforms by deploying it.
- Ensured inclusivity by providing accessibility features for all users, including those with disabilities.
- Enhanced document management by leveraging blockchain for secure and tamper-proof verification while enabling users to securely share and store NSID on IPFS for heightened security and accessibility.
- Implemented a dashboard for tracking scholarship applications and managing policies.
- Utilize Computer Vision and Image Processing techniques to extract relevant data from submitted documents.
- Develop real-time tracking for document and application status.
- Created a model to verify the document template using EasyOCR and PaddleOCR.
- Dialog flow bot for solving queries of the user and providing them with emails of the concerned authorities.
